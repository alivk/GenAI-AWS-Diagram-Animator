# GenAI-AWS-Diagram-Animator

GenAI-AWS-Diagram-Animator is an interactive application that generates animated AWS architecture diagrams based on a simple text specification. Built with Streamlit and Graphviz—and with optional AWS integration—this tool helps you quickly visualize and animate cloud architecture designs.

## Overview

The GenAI-AWS-Diagram-Animator allows users to define diagram nodes and connections using a plain-text format. The tool parses these inputs, calculates node positions and connection paths (including curved, dashed, and animated lines), and then generates an SVG diagram with smooth animations. It is useful for:
- Prototyping AWS architectural diagrams.
- Demonstrating dynamic relationships between services.
- Sharing visual designs with your team.

## Features

- **Text-Based Input:** Define nodes and connections (using connectors like `~>`, `to>`, `>>`, etc.) with a simple format.
- **Custom Animations:** Animated connections leverage SVG masks and CSS animations for a flowing visual effect.
- **Interactive Diagram Generation:** Built with Streamlit for an intuitive web UI.
- **Downloadable Output:** Generate an SVG diagram that can be viewed in the browser or downloaded.
- **AWS Integration (Optional):** Optionally invoke AWS Bedrock models through boto3 for GenAI services.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or above.
- AWS credentials configured (if using AWS Bedrock features).
- Graphviz (required for diagram generation).

### Dependencies

Install the required Python packages with pip:

## Usage

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/GenAI-AWS-Diagram-Animator.git
   cd GenAI-AWS-Diagram-Animator
   ```

2. **Configure AWS Credentials (if needed):**

   The application retrieves AWS Bedrock credentials from AWS Secrets Manager (using the secret named `bedrocksecrets`).

3. **Run the Application:**

   ```bash
   streamlit run main.py
   ```

4. **Enter Your Diagram Specification:**

   The default inputs are pre-populated:

   **Nodes:**
   ```
   [diagram nodes]
   LAYER1 - UserA
   LAYER2 - CloudfrontA
   LAYER2 - ALBA
   LAYER3 - WebServerA
   LAYER3 - WebServerB
   LAYER4 - AppServerA
   LAYER4 - AppServerB
   LAYER5 - DBServerA
   LAYER5 - DBServerB
   ```

   **Connections:**
   ```
   [diagram connection]
   UserA to> CloudfrontA 
   CloudfrontA to> ALBA 
   ALBA ~> WebServerA
   ALBA ~> WebServerB
   WebServerA ~> AppServerA
   WebServerA ~> AppServerB
   WebServerB ~> AppServerA
   WebServerB ~> AppServerB
   AppServerA ~> DBServerA
   AppServerB >> DBServerB
   ```

   **Animations (Optional):**  
   Leave this area empty or specify additional animations as needed.

5. **Generate the Diagram:**

   Click the **Generate Diagram** button to display the animated SVG diagram in your browser. You can also download the generated SVG file.

## Example

An example SVG diagram generated by the application is available in the repository. You can view it directly or click the link below:

- **[View Example Diagram](example.svg)**

> **Note:** Your markdown viewer (or GitHub) may render the SVG image inline. Ensure `example.svg` is in the repository root, so the relative path works properly.

## Project Structure

- **main.py**  
  The main Streamlit application code. It handles user input, node positioning, SVG generation, and file download.

- **bedrock_utils.py**  
  Contains helper functions, including AWS integration, diagram specification parsing, and utility functions.

- **example.svg**  
  An example SVG output generated by the application. This file is referenced in this README.

- **README.md**  
  This documentation file.

## Troubleshooting

- **SVG Parsing Errors:**  
  Ensure the diagram specification format is followed correctly. The application removes inline comments before generating the SVG.

- **AWS Credential Issues:**  
  Verify that your AWS credentials are correctly configured and that the application has access to AWS Secrets Manager.

- **Graphviz Issues:**  
  Confirm that Graphviz is installed and available in your system’s PATH.
